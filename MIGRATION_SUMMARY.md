# Migration Summary: Integration and Journal Endpoints

## What was migrated from everlight-b2 to everlight-api

### 1. API Endpoints
- **Journal Endpoints** (`api/journal_endpoints.py`)
  - `POST /journal` - Create new journal entry
  - `DELETE /journal/{entry_id}` - Delete journal entry
  
- **Integration Endpoints** (`api/integration_endpoints.py`)
  - `POST /integrations/notion/connect` - Connect Notion OAuth
  - `GET /integrations/notion/status` - Check Notion connection status
  - `DELETE /integrations/notion/disconnect` - Disconnect Notion
  - `POST /integrations/gmail/connect` - Future Gmail integration
  - `POST /integrations/calendar/connect` - Future Calendar integration

### 2. Authentication Module
- **User Authentication** (`auth/user_auth.py`)
  - Firebase ID token verification
  - User creation and retrieval from database
  - Dependency injection for protected routes

### 3. Dependencies Added
Updated `pyproject.toml` to include:
- `firebase-admin>=6.9.0` - For Firebase authentication
- `notion-client>=2.4.0` - For Notion API integration

### 4. Main App Configuration
Updated `main.py` to:
- Include the new router endpoints
- Configure CORS with proper origins
- Remove reference to non-existent `crud_endpoints`

### 5. Database Models
The database models were already synchronized between both projects, including:
- `User` - User accounts
- `JournalEntry` - Journal entries with metadata
- `IntegrationToken` - OAuth tokens for integrations
- `RawEntry` - Raw data from integrations

## Current Status
âœ… **Migration Complete** - All endpoints successfully migrated and tested

### Available Routes
- `/journal` (POST) - Create journal entry
- `/journal/{entry_id}` (DELETE) - Delete journal entry  
- `/integrations/notion/connect` (POST) - Connect Notion
- `/integrations/notion/status` (GET) - Check Notion status
- `/integrations/notion/disconnect` (DELETE) - Disconnect Notion
- `/integrations/gmail/connect` (POST) - Future Gmail integration
- `/integrations/calendar/connect` (POST) - Future Calendar integration
- `/health` (GET) - Health check

### Notes
- The integration endpoints reference `integrations.notion_importer` which may need to be copied if Notion import functionality is required
- Default agent creation was removed from user auth since the AI agent modules are not available in everlight-api
- All authentication and database functionality is preserved
